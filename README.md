**Proven tips and techniques for launching and running SAFe® Teams, ARTs, and Portfolios in an Agile Enterprise**

## What is this book about?
The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®) is widely recognized as an effective methodology for implementing Agile practices at the Enterprise level. However, the complexity of SAFe® can make it challenging for Teams and organizations to determine which practices can be safely adapted to their unique needs. Although SAFe® is a framework rather than a set of rules, promoting adaptation, it’s crucial to understand why SAFe® practices are designed the way they are along with the consequences of modifying them.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Discover how to set up Agile Teams to attain maximum effectiveness
* Avoid common mistakes organizations make with SAFe®
* Find out how to set up the Agile Release Train
* Discover common mistakes enterprises make that affect the success of the ART
* Understand the importance of Value Streams and learn how to work with them successfully
* Start using the best ways to measure the progress of Teams and ARTs at an Enterprise level
* Recognize the impact of successful SAFe® adoption on Enterprise strategy and organizational structure
